6th June
========
   ==> Variables

        -> Variables are names of memory locations
        -> Variables are used to store data
        -> Variables will be processed(read/update/delete) using programs

  -> Variable Syntax
    -> datatypes variables_Name = value;

  --> Data Types

    -> Data Types define the type of data and size for the data.

    -> Data Types Classification
      -> Primitive Data Types
      -> Non-Primitive Data Types(Reference Data Types)

    -> Primitive Data Types
      -> We Have 8 Primitive Data Types

        1: byte
        2: short
        3: Int
        4: long
        5: Float
        6: Double
        7: Char
        8: Boolean     


16th June - Loops
=================

--> Loop : Loops are used to EXECUTE block of code --> REPEATEDLY --> Based on CONDITION

  -> When to use Loops: To perform/Automate REPEATEDLY TASKS

--> Types Of Loops

  -> For Loop

    -> Ideal for situations, Where you already know in ADVANCE, how many times you 
       want to do a task.

    -> for {Intialiazation, condition, increment/Decrement}  

-> While Loop

  -> Ideal for situations, where you don't know in ADVANCE, how many times you
     want to do a task.

-> Do-While Loop

  -> Same as While Loop, but runs the code AT LEAST ONCE, before checking the CONDITION
